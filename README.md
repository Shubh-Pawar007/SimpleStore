## Challenges

1. As every journey has some challenges and so was ours. We initailly spent lot of time to choose idea for Hackathon project and to frame design for our project.
2. While working on project we faced difficulties while implementing sorting and filtering functionalities but we made several meetings to solve the issue and it was solved within time as we implemented it by using redux. We learnt to solve small but crusial problem. It was a great opprtunity and experience to learn a lot of things in short span.
